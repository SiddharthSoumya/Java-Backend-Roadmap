# Phase 0 — Git + Linux + Tooling

## My Git workflow (the one I will follow)
- branch naming:
- commit style:
- steps: branch -> commit -> push -> merge

## Commands I can use without looking
- git status / add / commit / push:
- branch / merge:
- revert vs reset:
- stash:

## Merge conflict: what happened + how I resolved it
- conflict markers:
- what I kept:
- final command sequence:

## Linux debugging flow
1) check logs (cat/tail/grep)
2) check process (ps/top)
3) check port (ss/netstat)
4) curl endpoint
